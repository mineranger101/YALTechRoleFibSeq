# YALTechRoleFibSeq
for a test 

this was done in powershell

to run the file I would download as a ps1 file and run in CMD prompt 

you can do windows + R key and type CMD to open command prompt 

no this was not done becuase you are a mac user NGL I totally just thought of that

I trust anyone on this page to be smart enough to follow along here if they need help and are a mac user: https://www.usenimbus.com/post/powershell-on-mac#:~:text=If%20you've%20ever%20used,Yes%2C%20you%20can!

if on windows though! 

once in CMD prompt run the file out of the correct directory ( IE if it is on your desktop ensure you are in your desktop directory ) 

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "FibSeq.ps1"

plug that in and run 

also the file yes.ps1 is what I wrote When I was first starting and went a bit too far past the instructions 

for any further help seek the help desk
